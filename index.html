        <h3>How to Say <em>Deanna</em>? </h3>
        <p>When it comes time to pronounce my name, many people enjoy putting their own remix onto how to say it. I have been called names ranging from de-Anna, Donna, de-Na, dee-na, and so on.<br> The correct way to pronounce my name is <em>day-nah</em>. When I was born, my father asked the labor and delivery nurse how to spell <em>day-nah</em>, and she spelled it as Deanna.</p>
